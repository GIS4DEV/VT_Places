Shallow waters near the shore are great for little ones learning how to tread water, while directly across the river, rocks provide a seven-foot-tall platform to leap into a 12-foot-deep water for the older, bolder crowd.  Bring a picnic and a blanket--it also boasts a sandy bank, grass picnic area, parking and toilet facilities. Or stop by American Flatbread for dinner afterwards. It's located just down the road."
